<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am an avid reader and I also enjoy learning new things everyday. As I am writing this I am learning web development, which I am very excited about. 
  I believe that my love for reading is an attribute that assists me in helping me to learn. I have a 14 year year old son, who doesn't like to read, whom I push hard
  to become a good reader so learning for him could be smoother - and maybe even more life changing.</p>

<p>I am 59 years old, but I believe I am never too old to keep learning; therefore, I am going to keep applying what I am learning from this web developement course and become
  a master at creating web pages. There are more courses for me to take, as this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I am going to take as many courses as I can from Dr. Angela Yu and her London App Brewery company - which I think is phenomenal. I am so fortunate to have come accross this course on Udemy, 
and for the price for each course why go anywhere else!
